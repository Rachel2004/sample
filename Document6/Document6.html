Every time you create an artwork there are 7 elements, or components, that your artwork consists of. More often than not we just take these elements for granted, 
or don't even give them a second thought.They are however critical to the success of your artwork. 
By keeping them in mind as plan and create your artwork, you will end up with a much better artwork.One that will be easier to look at 
as the person's eye will flow through your artwork more fluently. You will have control over how their eye moves through your painting - 
you will be able to lead them through the painting.This is just one of the benefits of knowing the 7 elements of art. 
Let's dive right in by looking at what these 7 elements are:<br>

<h2 align="left"><a name= "#Line">Line</a></h2>
There are many different types of lines, all characterized by their length being greater than their width. 
Lines can be static or dynamic depending on how the artist chooses to use them. 
They help determine the motion, direction and energy in a work of art. 
We see line all around us in our daily lives; telephone wires, tree branches, 
jet contrails and winding roads are just a few examples.
We use different types of lines to express different things; such as:<br>

<h2 align="left"><a name= "#Shape">Shape</a></h2>
A shape is defined as an enclosed area in two dimensions. By definition shapes are always flat, 
but the combination of shapes, color, and other means can make shapes appear three-dimensional, as forms. 
Shapes can be created in many ways, the simplest by enclosing an area with an outline. 
They can also be made by surrounding an area with other shapes or the placement of different textures next to each other—for instance,
 the shape of an island surrounded by water. Because they are more complex than lines, 
 shapes are usually more important in the arrangement of compositions. 
 
 <h2 align="left"><a name= "#Form">Form</a></h2>
 Form is sometimes used to describe a shape that has an implied third dimension. In other words, an artist may try to make parts of a flat image appear
 three-dimensional. Notice in the drawing below how the artist makes the different shapes appear three-dimensional through the use of shading. 
 It’s a flat image but appears three-dimensional.
 
 <h2 align="left"><a name= "#Space">Space</a></h2>
Space is the empty area surrounding or between real or implied objects. Humans categorize space: there is outer space, 
that limitless void we enter beyond our sky; inner space, which resides in people’s minds and imaginations, and personal space, 
the important but intangible area that surrounds each individual and which is violated if someone else gets too close. Pictorial space is flat, 
and the digital realm resides in cyberspace. Art responds to all of these kinds of space.<br>
Many artists are as concerned with space in their works as they are with, say, color or form. There are many ways for the artist to present ideas of space. 
Remember that many cultures traditionally use pictorial space as a window to view realistic subject matter through, 
and through the subject matter they present ideas, narratives and symbolic content.

<h2 align="left"><a name= "#Value">Value</a></h2>
Value (or tone) is the relative lightness or darkness of a shape in relation to another. The value scale, bounded on one end by pure white and on the other 
by black, and in between a series of progressively darker shades of grey, gives an artist the tools to make these transformations. 
The value scale below shows the standard variations in tones. Values near the lighter end of the spectrum are termed high-keyed, those on the darker end 
are low-keyed.

<h2 align="left"><a name= "#Color">Color</a></h2>
Color is the most complex artistic element because of the combinations and variations inherent in its use.  Humans respond to color combinations differently, 
and artists study and use color in part to give desired direction to their work.<br>
Color is fundamental to many forms of art. Its relevance, use and function in a given work depend on the medium of that work. 
While some concepts dealing with color are broadly applicable across media, others are not.<br>
The full spectrum of colors is contained in white light. Humans perceive colors from the light reflected off objects. 
A red object, for example, looks red because it reflects the red part of the spectrum. It would be a different color under a different light. 
Color theory first appeared in the 17th century when English mathematician and scientist Sir Isaac Newton discovered that white light could be divided into 
a spectrum by passing it through a prism.<br>
The study of color in art and design often starts with color theory. Color theory splits up colors into three categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary.

<h2 align="left"><a name= "#Texture">Texture</a></h2>
At the most basic level, Three-dimensional works of art (sculpture, pottery, textiles, metalwork, etc.) and architecture have actual texture 
which is often determined by the material that was used to create it: wood, stone, bronze, clay, etc. Two-dimensional works of art like paintings, 
drawings, and prints may try to show implied texture through the use of lines, colors, or other ways. When a painting has a lot of actual texture from the 
application of thick paint, we call that impasto.
